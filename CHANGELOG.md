## [1.5.0] - 2025-01-17

### Added

- **Patchline Toggle**: Added UI toggle in Settings to switch between "release" and "pre-release" patchlines without editing the .env file
  - Panel stores patchline preference in `/opt/hytale/data/panel-config.json`
  - When patchline changes, server files (HytaleServer.jar, Assets.zip, .hytale-version) are automatically deleted to trigger redownload on next container restart
  - Shows restart banner when patchline is changed

- **Dashboard Patchline Badge**: Added colored badge in Dashboard Server Info card showing current patchline
  - Green badge for "release"
  - Orange badge for "pre-release"
  - Falls back to panel setting when server info unavailable

- **Mod Store Localization**: Added multi-language support for mod descriptions and hints
  - Mod entries now support localized descriptions (DE, EN, PT-BR)
  - Added hints field for additional mod-specific information (e.g., port configuration notes)
  - EasyWebMap includes hint about configuring WEBMAP_PORT in .env

- **Translations**: Added German, English, and Brazilian Portuguese translations for:
  - Patchline settings and labels
  - Restart notifications
  - Mod store hints
  - Console reconnect and load all buttons

- **Console Reconnect Button**: Added manual reconnect button that appears when WebSocket connection is lost
  - Allows users to manually reconnect without refreshing the page

- **Console Load All Logs**: Added button to load all available logs from the server
  - Backend limit increased from 1,000 to 10,000 logs
  - `tail=0` parameter loads all available logs

- **Enhanced Update Check**: Update check now shows both release and pre-release versions
  - Backend checks both patchlines in parallel for faster results
  - Dashboard displays version cards for both release and pre-release
  - Active patchline is highlighted with colored border
  - "Update available!" indicator shown for each patchline with updates

### Fixed

- **Manager Container Healthcheck**: Fixed container showing "unhealthy" status
  - Increased healthcheck start-period from 5s to 30s
  - Added wget to alpine image for healthcheck command
  - Healthcheck now properly waits for application startup

- **Update Check Patchline**: Fixed hardcoded 'release' patchline in update check endpoint to use configured patchline setting

- **Console Log Stream**: Fixed log streaming issues where updates would stop arriving
  - Backend now automatically restarts log stream after 3 seconds when it ends or errors
  - Added Docker multiplexed stream demultiplexing to properly parse 8-byte header frames
  - WebSocket reconnection now uses exponential backoff (3s, 6s, 12s, 24s, 48s)
  - Added automatic retry after 30 seconds even when max reconnect attempts reached

- **Console Auto-Scroll**: Fixed auto-scroll not always scrolling to bottom
  - Added 100ms polling interval to continuously check if scroll is needed
  - Scroll function now retries multiple times to ensure DOM is fully rendered
  - Uses `flush: 'post'` and `requestAnimationFrame` for reliable timing

- **Console Store Reactivity**: Fixed logs not always updating in the UI
  - Changed from `slice()` to `splice()` for in-place array modification
  - Added update counter (`logsUpdated`) for guaranteed reactivity

- **Dashboard Patchline Display**: Fixed dashboard showing wrong patchline after switching
  - Now prioritizes panel setting (user's configuration) over plugin value
  - Plugin value is only used as fallback when panel setting unavailable

- **Backup Download**: Fixed "Missing or invalid authorization header" error when downloading backups
  - Changed from direct URL open to blob download via axios with auth header
  - Creates temporary download link for the file blob

- **Backup Size Display**: Fixed Hytale server backups showing as 0 MB
  - Added support for additional backup formats (.bak, .backup, backup_*, hytale_*)
  - Small files now show at least 0.01 MB instead of rounding to 0
  - Hytale server backups (backup_*) are now correctly detected as "auto" type
  - Added error handling for files with permission issues
